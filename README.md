Gradle library. Android AutoCompleteTextView that receives and displays US address suggestions from SmartyStreets's [US Autocomplete API](https://smartystreets.com/docs/cloud/us-autocomplete-api "US Autocomplete API").

[SmartyStreet's Android SDK](https://smartystreets.com/docs/sdk/android "SmartyStreet's Android SDK") does not offer address suggestions, it only offers address verification and zip code lookup.


## Demo

Demo app repository: https://github.com/RacZo/SmartyStreets-AutoComplete-Demo


## Dependencies

If your app is already using the following SUPER AWESOME libraries:

1. Google's Gson version 2.8.0 https://github.com/google/gson
2. Square's okhttp version 3.6.0 https://github.com/square/okhttp
3. Square's okhttp-logging-interceptor version 3.6.0 https://github.com/square/okhttp/tree/master/okhttp-logging-interceptor

you are set! If not, add the following to your app's build.gradle:

```groovy
compile 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.'
compile 'com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:3.6.0'
compile 'com.squareup.okhttp3:logging-interceptor:3.6.0'
```


## Installation

Via Gradle, by putting the following in your build.gradle:

```groovy
compile 'com.oscarsalguero:smartystreetsautocomplete:1.0.0'
```

Or Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.oscarsalguero</groupId>
  <artifactId>smartystreetsautocomplete</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
  <type>pom</type>
</dependency>
```

## Usage

1. Sign up for an account on https://smartystreets.com and create a Website key (API key).

2. Do not forget to add  ```<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />``` to your app's Manifest.xml.

3. Create an adapter class called "AddressAutocompleteAdapter" and make it extend "AbstractAddressAutocompleteAdapter", implement the required methods and define a layout for the dropdown item (R.layout.dropdown_text_item).

4. You will need your API key and a "referer" (host you entered when you created your key). The referer in your app must have "https://" as prefix or the API won't work.
    ```xml
    <com.oscarsalguero.smartystreetsautocomplete.SmartyStreetsAutocompleteTextView
        android:id="@+id/autocomplete_text_view"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:completionHint="Number Street, City State"
        android:completionThreshold="1"
        android:hint="Address"
        android:maxLength="100"
        app:ssacv_adapterClass=".adapter.AddressAutocompleteAdapter"
        app:ssacv_referer="YOUR_REFERER"
        app:ssacv_suggestions="5"
        app:ssacv_webApiKey="YOUR_WEBSITE_KEY" />
    ```

5. To capture the address selection (when the user taps a suggestion) you'll use the provided listener:

    ```java
    autoCompleteTextView.setOnAddressSelectedListener(new OnAddressSelectedListener() {
       @Override
       public void onAddressSelected(@NonNull Address address) {
       }
    });
    ```

And... voil√†!
